# Comments on project-luyanghua
1. This is an interesting project, the difference between the results obtained by the two software are striking. 
2. The biological importance of the work is well described.  
3. It would still be difficult to reproduce the entirety of the experiment as information on which software version of IMARIS or Fiji are not available in the documentation. However, the exact set of commands provided makes a good start for a reproducibility project.
4. Docx files are not great for version control as any change cannot easily be linked to a specific line. However, it is still preferable to version control than not. 
5. Recommendations: 
  - Document better the exact software (version, platform) used
  - If possible, create a container to host these software 
  - When using version control, use markdown files
  - Try your repository on a colleague to see how / if they could reproduce your work
6. Conclusion: this is a good work, a few computational aspects can be improved
